<h1 id="introduction">Introduction</h1>
<p>Randomness is an unavoidable part of the physical world. It is incomplete to talk about a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_quantity">physical quantity</a> without its associated error. The pair is typical written in the form of &quot;value ± error&quot; for symmetric errors. In the form of a graph, it is popular to present an error with a bar. An error bar is a straight line with two caps at the end, signaling the size of the error. However, there are some intrinsic and extrinsic problems causing it to be an ineffective representation. Error bars hide important information, namely coverages and distributions. They frequently cover less than the ranges of the errors. Despite that they emphasize the values within, the values outside are usually still important. They are visually uniform, but the underlying distributions are not. Their annotations are typically outside their graphs, somewhere in the text.</p>
<p style="background-color: whitesmoke; padding: 0.75rem; font-size: 1rem">All the source code plotting the graphs is available <a href="https://github.com/keithyipkw/blog/tree/master/post_supplements\error-bars">here</a>.</p>
<h1 id="meaning-of-error-bars">Meaning of Error Bars</h1>
<p>Error bars are graphical representations of errors. There are different kinds of errors, e.g., sampling errors, estimation errors, manufacturing errors, etc. Below is a summary of common quantifications of them.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>

</table>
<h1 id="information-hiding">Information Hiding</h1>
<p>An error distribution can be in any shape. The middle of an error bar is only a line. It does not carry any information about the distribution. Even worst, it looks like a uniform distribution. It is only acceptable when all the following strict conditions are met:</p>
<ol>
<li>Everyone agrees with the boundaries.</li>
<li>The bars show full ranges of errors.</li>
<li>Only the boundaries matter.</li>
</ol>
<p>Not agreeing with the boundaries does not render a result useless. Showing the distribution allows the audience to apply their criteria. In addition, a larger portion being further away from boundaries is practically better. There may be errors unaccounted for or future errors. Similarly, error bars are unhelpful when there are overlappings. Even if the overlapped ranges of different distributions are the same, the overlapped probabilities are generally different. When the audience does not have a certain degree of prior knowledge, they will use some guesswork to fill in the blank.</p>
<h1 id="inconsistent-coverages">Inconsistent Coverages</h1>
<p>The smaller the errors are, the better. Making them look smaller than they should is very tempting. Drawing only ±1 standard deviation is a common trick. At first glance, an error bar seems to suggest the audience to concern only about its range within. This coverage is rarely enough for real-world applications. For example, an error bar referring to ±1 standard deviation only covers 68% of samples for a normal distribution. The audience needs to extend the bars themselves, likely in their minds, if they know that they should. It may be easy to do so with one or two error bars but extremely challenging for multiple error bars or multi-way comparisons.</p>
<h1 id="alternatives">Alternatives</h1>
<p>Violin plots are good alternatives. Their effectiveness was proven in the paper &quot;Error Bars Considered Harmful: Exploring Alternate Encodings for Mean and Error&quot;<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. Violin plots use areas to present distributions. They leverage basic humans' visual skills in counting. As a result, the audience can judge the errors with a glance in simple cases. If error bars are drawn, they should be extended until meeting the criteria.</p>

<p>Gradient plots are other proven alternatives<sup><a href="#1">[1]</a></sup>. The audience understands that they represent fuzzy values without much explanation. The drawback is that it is difficult to draw and present them properly. Color is a complicated subject and hard to be done right. The graphs should accurately use colors to represent values. Otherwise, the audience will overweigh the values with unintentionally increased contrasts or vice versa. Typical software operates in non-linear perceptual color spaces. You are likely to draw perceptually distorted gradients. Besides, gradients in different colors give different visual contrasts. It is a problem if you use multiple colors. Furthermore, the audience may view the graphs with reduced contrasts or color distortions caused by poor conditions. They may view the graphs on incorrectly color-managed prints, using uncalibrated monitors, using projectors with environment light on, or viewing at large angles. There are likely 0.2% - 9% of your audience having color vision deficiency <sup><a href="#2">[2]</a></sup>. They may see reduced contrasts too. How much depends on how you draw your graphs. There are too many things to go wrong with gradient plots. Violin plots are clearer, simpler, and safer. It does not mean that gradient plots are inferior. There are trade-offs. It is just unfavorable to gradient plots. There exist situations where color accuracy is less of a problem, e.g., when the lengths of the gradients are short in a zoomed-out scale. In such cases, gradient plots may be good choices.</p>

<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>Error bars are inadequate to display errors. They hide information and are frequently drawn short. In summary, they are deceptive. To communicate with your audience more effectively, I would suggest you adopt the following measures:</p>
<ol>
<li>Use violin plots.</li>
<li>Draw the full coverages of the error criteria.</li>
<li>Annotate the error bars in the graphs.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are situations where gradient plots shine. However, gradient plots are tricky to draw and show right. You should consider the trade-offs carefully.</p>

    <title>A Case Study of Taking Back Digital Privacy</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This article is a case of helping my friend taking back their digital privacy. They are non-technical and lived together with their adversary. This article may help you if you are in a similar situation. However, you should seriously consider the possibility that the possessive persons would physically harm others when they are denied.</p>
<h1 id="background">Background</h1>
<p>Alex lived with Billy. Alex was quite a technical person but Billy was totally not. It was natural for Billy to rely on Alex on all technological problems. Alex set up all Billy's digital accounts and smartphones. It seemed to be fine until Alex's possession over Billy surfaced. Alex spied on Billy's emails, Whatsapp, and iCloud photos.</p>
<p>Billy decided to take back their privacy. Billy and their friend, friend C, started to do so but encountered a roadblock. They consulted me. During the discussion, I discovered that their original plan would not work. Alex could regain control in no time. It was actually not straight forward for Billy.</p>
<h1 id="situation">Situation</h1>
<p>The challenges were</p>
<ol>
<li>Alex had total control over Billy's accounts.</li>
<li>Alex and Billy lived together.</li>
<li>Alex had a tremendous advantage of technological knowledge over Billy.</li>
<li>Billy needed to write down all account passwords in a notebook to remember them.</li>
<li>Billy generally required face-to-face assistance on computer related issues but was overseas and far away from friend C and me.</li>
<li>Billy did not have a trustable computer which was confidently free of spywares.</li>
</ol>
<p>After a more in-depth discussion, I confirmed a set of fulfilled prerequisites just enough to take back the privacy</p>
<ol>
<li>Billy had been locking the phone with a password only.</li>
<li>They were able to physically secure the phone.</li>
<li>They had a nearby helping friend, friend D, who could follow my instructions with only remote assistance.</li>
<li>friend D had a PC.</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="outline-of-the-plan">Outline of the Plan</h1>
<p>A written plan was necessary. The process involved many steps which were easy to miss. Some were even needed to be verified first. The process would be in a hurry too. Taking back the accounts would trigger the service providers to send emails to the registered email address. It was nice to have a PC and a stable and high-speed internet connection so we could act efficiently but the process would still take several hours. If Alex checked Billy's emails during the process, they could simply change the passwords to block us.</p>
<p>The outline of the process was</p>
<ol>
<li>to make a backup.</li>
<li>to take back as many accounts as possible.</li>
<li>to migrate the forever insecure accounts.</li>
<li>to strengthen up the security setting of the phone.</li>
<li>to educate Billy on privacy protection.</li>
<li>to do routine security examinations.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="making-backups">Making Backups</h2>
<p>Billy used an iPhone. The only backup was on iCloud. It was unsafe to rely on using iCloud to back up while changing it. Using a PC to back up the phone gave an isolated copy.</p>
<p>You do not need to delete the backup immediately if you trust your helpers or computers. You may wait for a month to see if there is any missing data caused by the migration.</p>
<h2 id="taking-back-the-accounts">Taking Back the Accounts</h2>
<p>It involved removing signed in devices, changing the passwords, the recovery settings, and strengthening up the security settings. Changing the recovery and security settings would prevent Alex from taking control of the accounts again. I chose SMS as the 2-factor authentication here. I generally discourage anyone to do so because SMS was barely better than nothing. You should use an authenticator. Consider the complications for Billy to adopt them, especially in this stressful situation, it was acceptable to settle on SMS for the time being.</p>
<p>If you do not know the passwords, you may try to recover them from your computers. They may be stored in password managers in your browsers or OSes. If you do not have all your passwords, it worths trying existing passwords from other accounts.</p>
<h2 id="migration-of-insecure-accounts">Migration of Insecure Accounts</h2>
<p>Replacement accounts would be needed for the accounts if they could not be taken control of. It would need data migration. That of iCloud was the most dangerous. One wrong step would wipe the data. This was the reason to have an isolated backup.</p>
<h2 id="strengthening-up-the-security-setting-of-the-phone">Strengthening up the Security Setting of the Phone</h2>
<p>The phone, having access and the ability to grant new access to the accounts, would be an attractive target for Alex to attack. Existing iCloud backup and jailbreaks should be removed. All biometric authentications, e.g. face unlock and fingerprint unlock, should be disabled. I confirmed there was no iCloud locks on the phone so there was no need to buy a new phone. I also confirmed that Billy was the solo legal owner of the phone number. Alex could not get a new SIM card for the phone number from the telecom provider without breaking some serious law. The SIM card was removable so a SIM lock was required to prevent Alex from simply loading Billy's SIM into another phone. SMS previews on the lock screen should be disabled to prevent Alex from peeking the codes for 2-factor authentications.</p>
<h2 id="user-education-on-privacy-protection">User Education on Privacy Protection</h2>
<p>All the defenses above would be broken if Billy was not careful. Billy should keep the phone nearby all the time. They should never give Alex the phone. Billy might be used to seek help from Alex but this should be stopped. They should never log in to these accounts in the shared PC too.</p>
<h2 id="periodic-follow-up-examinations">Periodic Follow-up Examinations</h2>
<p>To ensure the effectiveness of the measures, periodic follow-up examinations would be necessary. There might be loopholes in the plan, flaws in the execution, or slip-ups in securing the phone. Luckily, major service providers showed users all record of login activities nowadays. It would be pretty easy to check if Alex broke into Billy's accounts.</p>
<h1 id="planned-procedure">Planned Procedure</h1>
<p>I will not show any screenshots here. UI changes frequently. It is very easy to Google the screenshots if you get lost. You will need to modify it to fit your needs as well.</p>
<h2 id="disabling-mobile-network">Disabling Mobile Network</h2>

<ol>
<li>Connect the phone to the PC.</li>
<li>Click the small phone icon in iTunes.</li>
<li>Confirm if there is no sensitive data on the phone.</li>
<li>If there is sensitive data, enable password-protected backup in iTunes. Remember to disable it later.</li>
<li>Click the backup button to backup the whole phone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="downloading-original-photos-and-videos">Downloading Original Photos and Videos</h2>
<ol>
<li>Check data usage of iCloud photos by going to Settings → Apple ID → iCloud → Manage Storage.</li>
<li>Check local free disk space and data usage of the Photos app by going to Settings → iPhone Storage.</li>
<li>Proceed if the free disk space plus the data usage of the Photos app is more than the data usage of iCloud photos.</li>
<li>Download the photos by going to Settings → Photos → select Download and Keep Originals.</li>
<li>Open Photos → the Photos tab.</li>
<li>Wait for the download to complete as shown at the bottom.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="itunes-backup-again">iTunes Backup Again</h2>
<ol>
<li>Connect the phone to the PC.</li>
<li>Click the small phone icon in iTunes.</li>
<li>Click the &quot;Backup&quot; button to backup the whole phone.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="separate-photos-and-videos-backup">Separate Photos and Videos Backup</h2>
<p>Live photos and burst shots are not copied by this method.</p>
<ol>
<li>Unplug then plug the phone into a PC.</li>
<li>Select &quot;Trust&quot; in the &quot;Trust This Computer&quot; prompt on the phone.</li>
<li>Open the phone like a USB stick in the file explorer on the PC.</li>
<li>Copy the enclosing folder to the PC.</li>
<li>Check the size of the copied folder.</li>
<li>At least open some photos to check the integrity.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="taking-back-accounts">Taking Back Accounts</h2>
<p>The basic ideas are to sign out all other devices, reset all recovery methods and passwords, and enable 2-factor authentications. It should be started from the email that was used to registered other services. The following steps work for Google accounts. Those for other major service providers like Microsoft are similar. There should be no new logins on the phone until signing out all iCloud logins on other devices. Otherwise, iCloud backup can be abused to continue to spy on you by restoring the backup on other devices. If you cannot do any of the steps, you will need to create a new one for the corresponding account.</p>
<ol>
<li>Login in a browser on a PC.</li>
<li>Go to Account Settings → Security → Your Devices → Manage devices.</li>
<li>Sign out all other devices.</li>
<li>Under &quot;Ways that we can verify that it's you&quot;, remove recovery emails and phones which are under other people's control. These steps apply to all recovery accounts and all recovery accounts of them.</li>
<li>Change all other recovery methods, e.g. security questions, if there are any.</li>
<li>Change the password.</li>
<li>Enable 2-Step Verification with SMS.</li>

<ol>
<li>Open Whatsapp.</li>
<li>Open Settings.</li>
<li>Tap WhatsApp Web/Desktop.</li>
<li>Remove all devices listed there. Being asked to scan a QR code means that there are currently no other logins.</li>

<li>Check for unknown Apps under Camera and Microphone too.</li>
<li>Go back to the home screen.</li>
<li>Check for unknown Apps one by one.</li>
<li>Delete any unknown and preferably unused Apps.</li>
<li>If you remove any apps, do an iTunes backup again.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="jailbreak-removal">Jailbreak Removal</h2>
<p>I am not a jailbreak expert. I am not sure if it is possible to hide jailbreak status. I could not find any resources online. My guess is that hiding jailbreak status should be possible when ones have root access. There are apps to hide some other apps on the home screen (SpringBoard). If you want to be sure, it is better to do a DFU restore anyway.</p>
<ol>
<li>Check if there is an app called Cydia. Continue if yes.</li>
<li>Sign out iCloud.</li>
<li>Backup using the PC again.</li>
<li>Do a DFU restore.</li>
<li>Restore the phone from the PC.</li>
<li>Do an iTunes backup again.</li>

<h1 id="execution">Execution</h1>
<p>The process took only 3 - 4 hours, greatly thanks to friend D being an above-average computer user and an extra phone for showing me their screens. We spent quite a substantial amount of time trying to take the accounts back. We could not take Billy's Microsoft email account back because of not knowing the password and answers to the security questions. We applied for a review of our declaration of our ownership of the account. We could not take iCloud account back too so we did an iCloud migration. There were only small deviations from the plan which they were easy to deal with. There was time for me to educate Billy on how to protect their digital privacy.</p>
<h1 id="result">Result</h1>
<p>A few days later, Alex sneakily attempted to take Billy's phone and acted suspiciously. This was a sign of temporary success. However, I suspected that Alex knew the password of the phone. Billy ensured that Alex did not know the password of the phone. It was a stressful enough situation so I did not push Billy to use a new password.</p>
<p>We did not receive any responses from Microsoft so the email account was lost forever. Billy would notify their friends of the new email address in person. To ensure the security would hold, friend D would help Billy to perform the routine maintenance. That was the best we could do for the moment.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>The procedure was lengthy and might seem complicated to most people. It was harder to defend than attack. One did not know how their adversaries would attack so the defense had to thoroughly cover all angles. The procedure was slightly different from the best practice for digital security. It was required to suit the rather unusual situation. It was unfortunate that we could not take back all accounts.</p>]]></content>
