For a player having a starting life from 1 to 96 before playing a level, there is no censorship in the observation of their life change after beating the level. However, if they have a starting life from 97 to 99, the observed life change is capped. When mixing these samples with the former samples, we need to take care of this \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)\"\u003eright censoring\u003c/a\u003e problem.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe \u003ca href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator\"\u003eKaplanâ€“Meier estimator\u003c/a\u003e is our solution. We will group the probabilities of life changes that the censoring does not skew the estimation. By applying the same technique to each group containing multiple life changes and ignoring the censored samples useless to the subgroups, we will be able to estimate the probabilities of each subgroup. Repeating the steps will eventually give us the probabilities of each life change.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBecause we are dealing with a right censoring, we will estimate the probabilities from the most life loss toward the most life gain. For life losses, we will simply count the proportion for each one and group the remaining for life gain greater than or equal to 0. Doing so will allow us to include the censored samples when estimating the probabilities of each group. After throwing away the samples with 99 starting lives and negative life changes, we will count the proportion for 0-life change and group the remaining for 1 or more life gain. The overall proportion for 0-life change will be the product of the previous proportion for 0 or more life gain and the current proportion for 0-life change. By repeating a similar procedure for 1 to 3-life gains, we will get the probabilities for all life changes using all the samples.\u003c/p\u003e\n\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n\u003cimg\r\nclass=\"mx-auto leading-none\"\r\nsrc=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a.png\"\r\nsrcset=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a_2x.png 2x\"\r\nalt=\"For example, a player having 97 starting lives gained 1 life once and 2 lives 6 times.

The censoring of a sample depends on the starting life where the life is the sum of the starting lives and the life change of its predecessor. The probabilities of life changes correlate with the censoring. The better the player is, the heavier the censoring there is. It is not obvious if a simple non-parametric bootstrap will work. Instead, we use parametric bootstraps with a model of the sampling process to calculate the confidence intervals.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLike the non-parametric counterparts, the BCa version is the least restrictive and generally provides the most accurate confidence intervals. However, it is more complicated than the non-parametric counterpart, especially when dealing with correlated samples. The details can be found in section 4 of \u003cem\u003eThe Automatic Construction of Bootstrap Confidence Intervals\u003c/em\u003e by Bradley Efron and Balasubramanian Narasimhan\u003csup id=\"fnref:1\"\u003e\u003ca href=\"#fn:1\" class=\"footnote-ref\" role=\"doc-noteref\"\u003e1\u003c/a\u003e\u003c/sup\u003e.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eRather than jumping into another deep rabbit hole immediately, we will spend some time studying the problem first by examining the actual differences between the samples obtained by different sampling processes. Below are some simulations of the original sampling, a multinomial sampling, and a non-parametric resampling process. Including the resampling process will help us to decide if a BCa bootstrap is necessary. There were 1058 samples of levels from part 1. The life change probabilities given by the Kaplan-Meier estimator formed a multinomial distribution. It was the basis of the simulations for the original sampling and multinomial sampling.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe original sampling process drew a sequence of 1058 levels from the distribution with replacements. It assigned 15 starting lives to the first level. The starting lives for each successive level were the sum of the current start lives and the life change. They were less than or equal to 99. Whenever a starting life fell below 1, it became 15 as if a run restarted. The Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator gave an estimate of the life change probabilities for a new set of samples. In the simulation, I repeated the process 1,000,000 times and obtained distributions of the simulated estimates.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIn the multinomial sampling, drawing 1058 levels was the whole process. There was no censoring. The process was simple enough that a formula for the exact distributions existed. I did not have to run a simulation.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe resampling was the same as those in non-parametric bootstraps. It directly drew new sets of 1058 samples from the 1058 samples with replacements. Like the other simulation, I repeated it 1,000,000 times and obtained the corresponding distributions again.\u003c/p\u003e\n\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n\u003cimg\r\nclass=\"mx-auto leading-none\"\r\nsrc=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf.png\"\r\nsrcset=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf_2x.png 2x\"\r\nalt=\"The probabilties of Panga\u0026#39;s life change after beating a level estimated by the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator.\"\u003e\r\n\u003cfigcaption class=\"text-center text-raven-500\"\u003e\r\n\u003cp\u003eThe probabilties of Panga's life change after beating a level estimated by the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator.\u003c/p\u003e\r\n\u003c/figcaption\u003e\r\n\u003c/figure\u003e\r\n\n\r\n\r\n\u003cfigure\u003e\r\n\u003cimg\r\nclass=\"mx-auto leading-none\"\r\nsrc=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf.png\"\r\nsrcset=\"/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf_2x.png 2x\"\r\nalt=\"The cumulative distributions of the probabilities of 1 life loss by the simulated sampling processes.

The upper confidence limits were non-sensible after 1200 levels. They rose slightly after 1200 levels. The state of a run can never transit from ended to in-progress, so the success rates must be monotonic decreasing. A similar logic applies to the bootstrap replications of the success rates too. The distribution of the bootstrap replications is an ordered set of success rates. Although the success rates for different life change probabilities may reorder in the next number of levels, an element in an ordered set of the success rates are monotonic decreasing. The lower confidence limits plateaued between 1200 to 1500 levels. It probably traced back to a sudden increment of around 750 levels suggested by the coverage simulation. The randomness in the bootstrap did not cause the weirdness. We used a large enough number of bootstrap replications that the confidence limits converged. Running the bootstrap with different random seeds would give the same result. These issues happened because we used the BCa bootstrap to calculate with extreme confidence limits.

For a player having a starting life from 1 to 96 before playing a level, there is no censorship in the observation of their life change after beating the level. However, if they have a starting life from 97 to 99, the observed life change is capped. When mixing these samples with the former samples, we need to take care of this <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Censoring_(statistics)>right censoring</a> problem.</p><p>The <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaplan%E2%80%93Meier_estimator>Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator</a> is our solution. We will group the probabilities of life changes that the censoring does not skew the estimation. By applying the same technique to each group containing multiple life changes and ignoring the censored samples useless to the subgroups, we will be able to estimate the probabilities of each subgroup. Repeating the steps will eventually give us the probabilities of each life change.</p><p>Because we are dealing with a right censoring, we will estimate the probabilities from the most life loss toward the most life gain. For life losses, we will simply count the proportion for each one and group the remaining for life gain greater than or equal to 0. Doing so will allow us to include the censored samples when estimating the probabilities of each group. After throwing away the samples with 99 starting lives and negative life changes, we will count the proportion for 0-life change and group the remaining for 1 or more life gain. The overall proportion for 0-life change will be the product of the previous proportion for 0 or more life gain and the current proportion for 0-life change. By repeating a similar procedure for 1 to 3-life gains, we will get the probabilities for all life changes using all the samples.</p><figure><img class="mx-auto leading-none" src=/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a.png srcset="/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/estimator_example_1a_2x.png 2x" alt="For example, a player having 97 starting lives gained 1 life once and 2 lives 6 times.

$$<h1 id=sampling-process>Sampling Process</h1><p>The sampling process is different from independently drawing samples from a distribution with replacements that non-parametric bootstraps work perfectly. The censoring of a sample depends on the starting life where the life is the sum of the starting lives and the life change of its predecessor. The probabilities of life changes correlate with the censoring. The better the player is, the heavier the censoring there is. It is not obvious if a simple non-parametric bootstrap will work. Instead, we use parametric bootstraps with a model of the sampling process to calculate the confidence intervals.</p><p>Like the non-parametric counterparts, the BCa version is the least restrictive and generally provides the most accurate confidence intervals. However, it is more complicated than the non-parametric counterpart, especially when dealing with correlated samples. The details can be found in section 4 of <em>The Automatic Construction of Bootstrap Confidence Intervals</em> by Bradley Efron and Balasubramanian Narasimhan<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup>.</p><p>Rather than jumping into another deep rabbit hole immediately, we will spend some time studying the problem first by examining the actual differences between the samples obtained by different sampling processes. Below are some simulations of the original sampling, a multinomial sampling, and a non-parametric resampling process. Including the resampling process will help us to decide if a BCa bootstrap is necessary. There were 1058 samples of levels from part 1. The life change probabilities given by the Kaplan-Meier estimator formed a multinomial distribution. It was the basis of the simulations for the original sampling and multinomial sampling.</p><p>The original sampling process drew a sequence of 1058 levels from the distribution with replacements. It assigned 15 starting lives to the first level. The starting lives for each successive level were the sum of the current start lives and the life change. They were less than or equal to 99. Whenever a starting life fell below 1, it became 15 as if a run restarted. The Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator gave an estimate of the life change probabilities for a new set of samples. In the simulation, I repeated the process 1,000,000 times and obtained distributions of the simulated estimates.</p><p>In the multinomial sampling, drawing 1058 levels was the whole process. There was no censoring. The process was simple enough that a formula for the exact distributions existed. I did not have to run a simulation.</p><p>The resampling was the same as those in non-parametric bootstraps. It directly drew new sets of 1058 samples from the 1058 samples with replacements. Like the other simulation, I repeated it 1,000,000 times and obtained the corresponding distributions again.</p><figure><img class="mx-auto leading-none" src=/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf.png srcset="/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/life_change_pmf_2x.png 2x" alt="The probabilties of Panga's life change after beating a level estimated by the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator."><figcaption class="text-center text-raven-500"><p>The probabilties of Panga's life change after beating a level estimated by the Kaplanâ€“Meier estimator.</p></figcaption></figure><figure><img class="mx-auto leading-none" src=/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf.png srcset="/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/-1_life_gain_cdf_2x.png 2x" alt="The cumulative distributions of the probabilities of 1 life loss by the simulated sampling processes.

That by the resampling was indeed very close to that by the original sampling, but that by the multinomial sampling was even closer. Using only certain numbers of initial samples, e.g., 25% or 50%, gave similar results.

The upper confidence limits were non-sensible after 1200 levels. They rose slightly after 1200 levels. The state of a run can never transit from ended to in-progress, so the success rates must be monotonic decreasing. A similar logic applies to the bootstrap replications of the success rates too. The distribution of the bootstrap replications is an ordered set of success rates. Although the success rates for different life change probabilities may reorder in the next number of levels, an element in an ordered set of the success rates are monotonic decreasing. The lower confidence limits plateaued between 1200 to 1500 levels. It probably traced back to a sudden increment of around 750 levels suggested by the coverage simulation. The randomness in the bootstrap did not cause the weirdness. We used a large enough number of bootstrap replications that the confidence limits converged. Running the bootstrap with different random seeds would give the same result. These issues happened because we used the BCa bootstrap to calculate with extreme confidence limits. The BCa bootstrap was unstable when the confidence intervals were larger than 95%<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup>.</p><figure><img class="mx-auto leading-none" src=/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/part1_pangas_probabilities_simplified.png srcset="/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/part1_pangas_probabilities_simplified.png 1x,/blog/image/no_skip_smm_2/part1_pangas_probabilities_simplified_2x.png 2x" alt="The confidence limits from part 1.

In comparison, the BC bootstrap performed better than the BCa bootstrap. It gave similar results most of the time but without instability. Combining it with the result from the previous section that the non-parametric resampling process approximated the original sampling process well, we can conclude that the parametric BC bootstrap is the way to go.
